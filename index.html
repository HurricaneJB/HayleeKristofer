<br>I love you the mostest.<br>
  
<br>When I say I love you the mostest, I don't mean I love you more than you love me.
<br>I love you more than any of the bad days ahead of us.
<br>I love you more than any fight we will ever have.
<br>I love you more than the distance that has been between us.
<br>I love you more than any challenge that we will face and obstacle in our way.
<br>I love you more than words can define, feelings can express, and thought can imagine.<br>
  
<br><b>I love you the mostest.</b><br>
